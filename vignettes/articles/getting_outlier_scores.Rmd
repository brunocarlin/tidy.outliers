title: "Getting outlier Score"

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(dplyr)
library(tidy.outliers)
library(recipes)
```

One of the most import aspects of tidyoutliers may be that you want to model something directly using the outlier score, that is pretty easy to do

# Mahalanobis Score

Prep your recipe.

```{r}
example_recipe <- 
  recipe(. ~ .,data = mtcars) |>
  step_outliers_maha(all_numeric())
```


Juice it. 

```{r}
example_recipe |>
  prep() |> 
  juice()
```
You can even give it a new name!


```{r}
example_feature <- 
  recipe(. ~ .,data = mtcars) |>
  step_outliers_maha(all_numeric(),name_mutate = 'maha') |> 
  prep() |> 
  juice()

example_feature |> select(maha,everything())
```
